# packit (packages kit)
A simple real-time package manager.

So, packit is written in spl and therefore runs in real time. It can work with packages in a less fussy way, so I thought why not use it in everyday tasks. It is worth remembering that the functionality depends on the stage of development of the language, and to work you need spl >= 0.2.0
