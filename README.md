# packit (Packages Kit)
A simple real-time package manager.

So, packit is written in [RTS](https://github.com/miruji/rts) and therefore runs in real time. It can work with packages in a less fussy way, so I thought why not use it in everyday tasks. It is worth remembering that the functionality depends on the stage of development of the language, and to work you need RTS >= 0.1.0
